# PRODIGY_DS_05 - US Accidents Analysis and Visualization

## Task Description
In this task, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing road accidents across the United States. The goal was to analyze accident severity, time distribution, and environmental conditions that may contribute to accidents.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Folium

## Key Steps
- Loaded and inspected the dataset 
- Checked for and handled missing values
- Converted timestamps to datetime and extracted the accident hour
- Visualized:
  - Distribution of accident severity
  - Frequency of accidents by hour of day
  - Top 10 weather conditions during accidents
- Created an interactive **Folium map** showing accident locations using a random sample

## Output
